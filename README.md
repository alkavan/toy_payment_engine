# Toy Payment Engine

This is an implementation of a basic payments and transactions engine using some
concepts from a role based paradigm called [DCI](https://dci.github.io/).

You can run the program with `RUST_LOG=info` variable,
this would print out more log messages and information.
Otherwise, the program should print logs only upon errors.
